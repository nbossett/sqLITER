# sqLITER
C++ Wrapper for SQLite (Embedded Database Library)

sqLITER is a simplified wrapper to access the widely used SQLite database library which is written on a C API model.  Licensing is GPL Lesser (Library) License v3.0.  The name comes from the idea of it being even lighter; the intended pronounciation is "sqLITER -> seek lighter".

This wrapper preserves that basic call/return value API philosophy but will eventually raise exceptions as an option.

The intent is to provide the power of SQLite in a very accessible form that can have a user up and running successfully in minutes.

A user's manual and more thorough explanations of design philosophy may be found in the docs folder.

This project grew out of personal needs; I hope that others may find it as useful.  Many thanks to the SQLite folks for their outstanding work!
